# day37_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

# Habit Tracker Project
This project is a habit tracker application built using Python and the Pixela API. It enables users to track their daily habits and visualize progress over time. During the development of this project, I learned several key concepts and techniques, including advanced authentication using HTTP headers and performing various HTTP requests such as POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.

## Key Features and Learnings

1. __Advanced Authentication Using HTTP Headers__

  - __Why Use HTTP Headers for Authentication?__
Using HTTP headers for authentication helps prevent sensitive information, such as API keys, from being exposed in URLs. This approach enhances security by ensuring that API keys are included in the request headers rather than in the query string or request body, reducing the risk of data leakage and interception.

2. __HTTP Methods: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE__

__POST__
- Used for creating new resources on the server. For example, creating a new user account or adding a new habit entry.
- Example: Creating a new graph for tracking a habit.

__GET__
- Used for retrieving information from the server. For example, fetching the details of a specific habit or user account information.
- Example: Retrieving user data.

__PUT__
- Used for updating existing resources on the server. For example, modifying an existing habit entry.
- Example: Updating a habit entry.

__DELETE__
- Used for deleting existing resources on the server. For example, removing a habit entry or deleting a user account.
- Example: Deleting a habit entry.
